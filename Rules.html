<h1>How to play:</h1>

<pre>Eating simulator! No, it's not all about eating simulation. It's an adventure game! Find ingredients, annoy librarians, get useless and annoying outputs from a computer, and much more! <h1>Much more? much this:</h1></pre>

<pre>You look for ancient scrolls, wait outside  a metal door for the whole night! <h1>So, how is this fun? how:</h1></pre>

<pre>Because there is much fun quests, jokes and other ridiculous stuff in the game! And, it also updates so you can get a few suprises. <h1>But i don't understand how to play!</h1>

You can figure it out. don't worry.

<h1> How did you come up with the idea?</h1>

We litterally copied a game called candybox2.

<h1>Aren't you going to get copyrighted?</h1>

We just copied the idea from candybox2. not the code.

<h1>Is eating simulator more fun then candybox2?</h1>

Yes

<h1>Then, sohuld i play it now, in 5 minutes, never?</h1>
